Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I've been exposed to coding opportunities in my undergraduate studies (Major: Honors Physics of Biology, Minor: Math) including an Honors Computational Neuroscience thesis (Python, MATLAB), internships (Python, MATLAB, bioinformatics) as well as personal projects (SwiftUI/Storyboard, Python, Javascript). I also received certification for completing a 24-week intensive course in Applied Machine Learning and Data Science from Columbia University Engineering Executive Education covering data science, visualization, and manipulation as well as machine learning covering many supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques.

I have published here several Python and MATLAB scripts I developed in collaboration with the Zochowski lab at the University of Michigan during my thesis work. My thesis consisted of an in-depth analysis of the effects of background noise on speech intelligibility for hidden hearing loss sufferers (hence the title of the paper!) My research included gathering neuronal response data to disrupted sinusoidal waves to sound signals simulating speech in noisy environments. This data was gathered using the MATLAB and Python scripts you can find in the "JL Thesis/Commented Code" folder. There you will also find collected data and outputs I created during my research.

You can run the entire simulation yourself as well by using the command line to run "calcReleaseProbs.m" followed by using the command line to run "generate_AN_spikes.py" (collecting data), then plotting said data in a convolution, raster plot, or colormap.


Take a look and feel free to reach out with any questions. Thanks!
