Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
I appreciate you taking the time to checkout my work despite my non-CS major. 

I've been exposed to coding opportunities in my undergraduate studies (Major: Honors Physics of Biology, Minor: Math) including an Honors Computational Neuroscience thesis (Python, MATLAB), internships (Python, MATLAB, bioinformatics) as well as personal projects (SwiftUI/Storyboard).

I have published here several Python and MATLAB scripts I developed in collaboration with the Zochowski lab at the University of Michigan during my thesis work. Take a look and feel free to reach out with any questions. Thanks!
